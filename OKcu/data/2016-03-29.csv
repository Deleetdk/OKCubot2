"Snazzy_Azzy","t_selfsum"," I'm a fairly easy-going guy who is just looking for a special someone I can share my time with. As one might be able to decipher reading the rest of my profile, I am into a VERY WIDE ARRAY of things, both normal and "nerdy". From sports and music to gaming (both video and tabletop) and anime (japanese animation), I am fairly easy to entertain and fun to be around. :-)

I'm looking for friends at first, hoping it develops into something more. Kinda hoping for my own lifelong "Player 2" soon.

Random Fact: I have a HUGE weakness for redheads. So if you are, kudos to you. ;)

I currently have a girlfriend now, so only looking for Friends. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_doingwithlife"," Currently working at a nearby Walmart. Maybe not a most ideal job
by some standards, but it's at least a paycheck. :)
I'm also a staff member Geek.Kon, Wisconsin's Premier Convention
For All Things Geek. ;)

I did graduate from UWGB a few years ago with a Design Arts degree.
Things haven't quite gone the way I planned with it, but I have
made some use of it, having designed fliers for Kitsune Kon's video
game tournaments when I was involved with that convention. I will
continue to do so to some capacity with Geek.Kon, as well as run
it's Video Contest.

I also find myself on Facebook a lot in my spare time (if I'm not
busy watching Doctor Who).

Lastly, I also do a Tumblr blog as a hobby, mostly involving
Convention Recaps and GR2 (Geek Rave and Geek Rant) Weekly here:
/ "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_reallygood"," Making people laugh and smile. Having fun with things like bowling
ang golf, though I'm especially not that great at the latter.

I also make for a real good cuddle buddy, so I have been told. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_thinsaboutme"," My smile and easy-going attitude. They also notice the passion I
can display at times when cheering on my favorite sports teams (GO!
PACK! GO!). "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_favorite"," Favorite books: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Santa Vs. Satan: The Official Compendium of Imaginary Fights, my manga collection (which has some extent to it). I've recently started into the Fantasy Romance book series Souls of the Saintlands, currently in Book 3 of the series, An Open Enemy. Good times.

Favorite movies: Star Wars (original trilogy only), Star Trek (the reboot and the even numbered movies), Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World (seriously, go see it now if you haven't :P), anything by Mel Brooks, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, just to name a select few.

Favorite non-anime shows: Power Rangers, WWE RAW and SmackDown!, Psych, Gotham, Arrow, The Flash, SportsCenter, Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, Mythbusters, Macgyver, Star Trek: The Next Generation, again to only name a few.

Call me late to the party, but I just fairly recently got into Doctor who. Love it.

Favorite animes (I actually have a Top 20 list, but here's the Top 5): 1.) Fullmetal Alchemist/FMA Brotherhood 2.) Cowboy bebop 3.) Sword Art Online 4.) Noir 5.) Martian Successor Nadesico

Favorite music: I listen to many genres, but tend to focus most of my musical attention to rock (both modern and classic) as well as japanese rock and pop music.

Favorite Sports Teams: Green Bay Packers, Wisconsin Badgers, UWGB Fighting Phoenix, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Colorado Avalanche, Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Sounders, Tottenham Hotspur "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_neverdowithout"," 1.) My Friends.
2.) Someone to love.
3.) Sports (Huge fan of many sports and sports teams. Also an avid
bowler).
4.) My computer (and the graphic design programs I have on
it).
5.) Video games.
6.) Anime and manga. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_lotthinking"," Among other things: What my friends are up to, what show or shows I
feel like watching that night, why the toast always lands
butter-side down. :-P

Also wondering who would be cool enough to get me into some
Dungeons and Dragons. Been wanting to get into that for some time
now. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_fridaynight"," I'm usually just chilling out at home, watching tv or chatting with
some of my friends on the internet. I don't do bars much anymore. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_admit"," I can be a total flirt and I'm VERY good with my hands. ;)

I've also been told I am a FANTASTIC kisser. "
"Snazzy_Azzy","t_messageme"," You're looking for someone to talk nerdy to and can at least
tolerate my sports-loving side. ;)

Also if you love a guy who is a cuddler that likes being
affectionate with their significant other. Being honest and upfront
with me is huge.

ONE MORE THING!!!!--- "Text Speak" (for example: rly, lol, idk) is
the #1 TURN-OFF for me. I don't expect perfect grammar and
punctuation when I read profiles. But if I look at it and if it
resembles a mess you'd see in most internet chat rooms, chances are
about 99.99% I won't reply to or message you. "

"bostonsoccerguy","t_selfsum"," I am big into sports, watch and play... i am very independent and
easy-going... I grew up all over the world, but mostly in Boston
and Coral Gables... and went to school in New England... as i said,
I like sports but at the same time kind of like a numbers guy... i
am not a big club/bar scene guy... sometimes i'd rather stay in and
watch a movie or cook together with someone than go out and get
wasted... although i do enjoy going to sport bars and watch
games... i prefer someone that likes sports and is smart enough to
have a conversation for more than 30 minutes...

I usually go to a few sports game every season, mostly football,
baseball and basketball (in that order). Last NFL season, I went to
the Pats - Bills opening game in Buffalo (very close call) and to
the Falcons - PATS game (another close call), also Jets and
Panthers away games...and Giants - Vikings game in nyc (the Vikings
are my 2nd favorite team)... Was at game 6 of the World Series when
the Red Soxs beat the Cards to win the World Series (4th row behind
home plate)... it was surreal... one of my best sports experiences
ever

Last year I went to the Final Four in Atlanta. If you haven't and
have to chance to go, regardless of what teams are playing, you
should... fun times

Went to a few games in Brasil for the World Cup... amazing!

I also like to travel a lot. I have been to 36 states and 32
countries. Im looking forward to increasing both numbers

btw i am very private and travel a lot. I live in NYC but usually
traveling. I stay away from drama and gossip... just saying "

"ComesTheDervish","t_selfsum"," I'm a sketchy mathematician who really likes gender ambiguity and climbing big things.

I also have good cheekbones. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_doingwithlife"," I'm doing a PhD in maths, and spend as much time as possible climbing rocks, and playing the guitar, and going on very cheap trips to places ostensibly to climb more things but also to have adventures and meet unusual people. Also in this category, I really like hitchiking and busking. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_reallygood"," The things I aspire to be really good at include sketchy maths, playing the guitar and the piano, and clawing my way up overhanging bits of rock.

I can also solve a Rubik's cube with only a small amount of confusion, juggle three balls for a short period of time and shuffle a deck of cards with one hand (except when I drop them all).

Oh, and I make good coffee. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_thinsaboutme"," The cheekbones, closely followed by the fact that I have no shame. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_favorite"," I'm more than a little obsessed with old fashioned rhythm & blues, like the Spencer Davis Group and early Rolling Stones.

It's socially unacceptable, but I also like country, albeit more Emmylou Harris than Dolly Parton.

Oh, and I have a soft spot for Hanoi Rocks, sadly I don't think the world was ready for glam-punk in 1981.

As for films, I like them to be stylish. Planet Terror is both stylish, features zombies, and the main character is a go go dancer with a machine gun for a leg.

And now the books section, with dating-website translations:

One of my favourite books is The Unbearable Lightness of Being. (This shows that I have hidden depths and an unconventional approach to life and casual romance.)

Other stand out books for me include A Clockwork Orange (i.e. I might have an excitingly dangerous side), The Passion of New Eve (showing that I'm not a believer in the gender binary), and The Master & Margarita (yes I have a secret urge to go naked broomstick riding).

I do spend more time reading Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams and Neil Gaiman than any of the stuff mentioned above. I used the Discworld points of the compass to explain rotating co-ordinate systems the other day. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_neverdowithout"," Universities: I'd never survive in the real world.
Rocks to climb on.
My guitar (made from spare parts when I was 14, I wanted to be
Brian May)
Coffee: with coffee, I am a better person who actually does
things.
Muesli: in fact I only get out of bed in the morning because I want
coffee and muesli. Sometimes, on special occasions, with Greek
yoghurt and honey....

Six is not a prime number so I'm stopping there. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_lotthinking"," I believe in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things, and
as such try to embrace a holistic approach to life, gender
confusion and mathematical physics. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_fridaynight"," Probably en route to some rocks with climbing equipment and a tent. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_admit"," I sometimes shave my legs, and I like the look on people's faces when they are shocked by that.

I can also enjoy unrestrained dancing while completely sober.

I sometimes feel very socially awkward, but as long as I'm comfortable saying 'Aargh human interactions are so difficult!' to someone, then I'm normally quite lucid. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_messageme"," You're one of the people who gave me lemons while I was busking in Leeds a few years ago. I prefer cash, but they did make some tasty lemonade....

OR, more seriously:

You want to go ski mountaineering.

You like taking photographs and want a model, or maybe you want a partner for acrobatics/climbing/surfing/urban exploration/board games/making music... or any combination of the above!

In general, I prefer meeting up with people to do things rather than just to consume expensive drinks and 'hang out'. Also, that doesn't just apply to dates - e.g. sitting in a park all day with a bottle of cider and a bunch of people that I really like is often actually quite a stressful day out for me. Having said that, I'm a sucker for cocktails. "
